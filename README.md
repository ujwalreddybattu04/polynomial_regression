# polynomial_regression
Polynomial Regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. It is useful when the data shows a non-linear relationship.

When to Use Polynomial Regression?
When data shows curved patterns.
When a linear regression model underfits the data.
When the relationship between variables is non-linear.

Limitations:
Overfitting: A high-degree polynomial may fit training data too well but fail on new data.
Computational Cost: As the degree increases, the model becomes more complex.
Extrapolation Issues: Predictions outside the given range may be unreliable.
